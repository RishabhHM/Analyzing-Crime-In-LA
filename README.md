# Analyzing Crime In Los Angeles

## Background
Los Angeles, California üòé. The City of Angels. Tinseltown. The Entertainment Capital of the World! Known for its warm weather, palm trees, sprawling coastline, and Hollywood, along with producing some of the most iconic films and songs!

However, as with any highly populated city, it isn't always glamorous and there can be a large volume of crime. This is the juncture where the project objective assumes significance.


## Objective
Support the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) by cleaning and analyzing the crime data to identify patterns in criminal behavior. The LAPD plans to use our insights to allocate resources effectively to tackle various crimes in different areas.


## Accomplishments in the Project
- Defined Problem Statement
- Data Collection and Inspection
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Predictive Modeling


## Data Sources
The Los Angeles crime data was obtained from [DATA.GOV](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present), an official website of the United States government. The data was downloaded as a CSV (Comma Seperated Value) format under the filename "crimes.csv" into the local system. However, the dataset is not been included in the reposritory due to space restrictions.

Aligned with the LAPD crime dataset, an additional dataset from the [Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)](https://www.bea.gov/tools/) was incorporated. This secondary dataset provides insights into the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), serving as a valuable resource for understanding the broader economic context within which crime patterns and factors are examined. The integration of this dataset facilitated the exploration of potential correlations between economic factors and crime rates. The dataset has been included in the reposritory under the filename "la_gdp.csv".
